Our aim is to make significant figures calculator which helps student to calculate answers in significant figures.
Significant Figures Calculator
This Python GUI application calculates significant figures in numerical values, helping students and professionals in physics and computer science handle precision in measurements accurately. Built with Tkinter for an intuitive interface, it supports input validation, rule-based counting, and clear result display—ideal for quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, or data science projects. The tool follows standard significant figure rules, including leading/trailing zeros and scientific notation.

Features
1.Processes decimal numbers, integers, and scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e-4).

2.Displays count of significant figures with explanations (e.g., "Leading zeros ignored").

3.User-friendly buttons for common operations like "Calculate" and "Clear".

4.Error handling for invalid inputs like non-numeric text.

5.Customizable for educational use, such as adding examples from Bohr's atomic model calculations.
